# release-verify — check that a release tag is what the release
# convention promises, after the workflow has landed it.
#
# The sharp assertion is that the tag is annotated and signed rather
# than merely present. Cog drives libgit2 and can only make a
# lightweight tag, which `push --follow-tags` silently leaves behind
# because that flag pushes annotated tags alone. release.yml deletes
# cog's tag and re-creates it signed to work around that, so a check
# asking only whether the tag exists would pass in exactly the case the
# workaround exists for.
#
# The commit under that tag gets the same treatment, and for a reason
# this task learned the hard way: it read the tag alone, and every
# release CI cut from v0.3.0 through v0.5.0 shipped a verified tag over
# an unsigned commit. A good tag implies nothing about the object beneath
# it. The two are signed by different parties here, so they are two
# assertions rather than one.
#
# It matters more than it looks, because the bump runs under --skip-ci
# and CI never validates the release commit. That is deliberate, and it
# leaves this task as the only thing standing between a bad release
# commit and every consumer pinning the tag.
#
# The tag is the whole release. This repository publishes no GitHub
# Release object, no release assets, and no built artifacts: consumers
# resolve the ref directly, through apm, the Go module proxy, a
# pre-commit rev, or a workflow pin. So nothing here looks for a
# release object, and finding none is correct rather than a gap.
#
# Read-only. It reads the local tag, the remote's refs, and the API, and
# writes nothing.
#
# Usage: release-verify.sh [vX.Y.Z]
#   With no argument it verifies the latest tag.
