"""Apply every vale finding that already carries its own correction.

Leave the rest alone.

Roughly a third of a typical run needs no judgment at all. Contractions
wants "don't" for "do not", WordList wants "turn off" for "disable",
OxfordComma wants a comma. The repo-local output template already prints the
replacement as replace_with= on the finding line, because the rule's own
action carries it. Reading those lines into a model and having it retype the
answer costs tokens to reproduce a lookup.

In the measured session behind this script, findings of this shape ran to
about 40 of 111. Applying them here leaves the model the findings that need
a decision.

Safety comes from refusing to guess. Vale gives a line and a column span,
and this checks that the span holds the exact text the finding quoted before
touching it. A span that holds anything else means the file moved under the
report, so that finding is skipped and named rather than applied. Findings
on one line apply right to left, so an earlier replacement never shifts a
later span.

Rules that rewrite meaning stay out by construction: a finding with no
replace_with is never touched, and that covers every distributional rule and
every judgment call.

Prints one line per applied change and one per skip. Silence means nothing
carried a replacement.

Usage:
    fix_prose_replacements.py <file>

Exit:
    0  every replacement that carried one was applied, and nothing was skipped
    1  at least one finding was skipped, vale failed to run, or the file
       does not exist
    2  the invocation was wrong

A nonzero exit is the normal end of a run with skips, not a failure of this
script. The shell version this replaced ran under `set -uo pipefail` with no
`-e` for exactly that reason: vale exits nonzero whenever it has findings,
and `-e` would have aborted the run before anything was applied. That hazard
does not survive the port, since nothing here treats a subprocess status as
fatal on its own, but the exit contract above is unchanged.
