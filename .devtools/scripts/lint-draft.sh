# lint-draft — run every prose gate over one drafted document, in a
# single call, and report all of it at once.
#
# The tasks this replaces each run one checker. `mise run lint-prose x.md`
# runs vale and says nothing about spelling or structure, so a document
# that clears it can still fail cspell and rumdl afterwards. Answering
# them one at a time is how a twenty-line file turns into four rounds:
# the measured session behind this script ran a linter on half of its
# 250 Bash calls, and 69 percent of the failing runs surfaced one or two
# findings apiece. Every gate reports here, whatever the ones before it
# found.
#
# The probe is the other half. Vale matches a path against the sections
# in .vale.ini, the match is exact, and a path no section names loads no
# styles at all. Vale then reads the file, applies nothing, prints
# nothing, and exits 0, which is byte for byte what a clean document
# produces. Measured in this repository: one paragraph of deliberately
# bad prose draws 13 findings as probe.md, and zero as probe.txt, zero
# under another name, and zero one directory down.
#
# So this sends known-bad text through vale under the target's own path,
# using --path to associate that path with stdin, and never touching the
# file. Findings mean the path carries rules. Silence from text this bad
# means the path carries none, and the clean run above proved nothing.
#
# Findings print in the shape the vale template uses, and the exit code
# carries the result.
#
# Usage: lint-draft.sh <file>
