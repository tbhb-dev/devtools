# Run native Go fuzz targets under the path in $1 (default the whole
# module). go test -fuzz takes one target regexp per invocation, so this
# lists every Fuzz* function under each package below the path and runs
# them one at a time for the FUZZ_TIME budget (default 30s). Seed-corpus
# failures fail the script, and new crashers land under each package's
# testdata/fuzz/.
#
# The `fuzz` task and the fuzz-nightly workflow both call this
# script; the workflow raises FUZZ_TIME for a longer scheduled sweep,
# mirroring the gremlins / mutate-go-all shape where one entry point powers
# both the inner loop and the scheduled run.
