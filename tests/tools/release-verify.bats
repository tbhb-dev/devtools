# Tests for tools/release-verify.sh.
#
# Scoped to the checks a throwaway repository can settle: a tag that is
# not there, a tag that is lightweight rather than annotated, and a
# release commit that nothing signed. No test here talks to GitHub.
#
# The lightweight case is the one worth holding. Cog can only make a
# lightweight tag, `push --follow-tags` pushes annotated tags alone, and
# release.yml deletes and re-creates the tag signed to compensate. A
# verifier that has only ever seen a good tag has not been tested against
# the failure it exists for.
#
# The unsigned-commit case is the second one, and it is the failure that
# actually shipped: every release CI cut, v0.3.0 through v0.5.0, carried
# a verified tag over a commit the runner wrote and nothing signed, while
# this task read the tag alone and called the release good.
#
# Neither signed path takes a fixture, and for the same reason from
# opposite directions. Fabricating a tag GitHub would call verified means
# holding the release signing key, and fabricating a signed release
# commit means holding GitHub's. Running the task against a real release
# tag is what exercises those halves.
