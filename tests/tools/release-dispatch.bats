# Tests for tools/release-dispatch.sh.
#
# The contract worth asserting is the command line it builds and the
# preflight it refuses on, so these drive the script as a subprocess with
# a stub `gh` on PATH recording what it was called with. Nothing here
# dispatches a workflow, and testing against the real one would mean
# cutting a release to find out.
#
# The readiness script resolves relative to the repository root, so a
# throwaway repository carrying a stub at that path is what lets these
# exercise both the pass and the refuse arm.
