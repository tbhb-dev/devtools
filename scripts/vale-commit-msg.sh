# Strip git's commit-message helper text and any verbose-diff
# scissors block from the commit-message buffer, then lint the result
# under vale's commit-message scope. The commit-msg hook fires before
# git's own cleanup pass, so the buffer still contains:
#
#   - Lines beginning with the comment character (`#` by default).
#     git adds these on `git commit --amend` or `git commit` without
#     `-F`/`-m` to remind the author what changed and what gets
#     ignored. The text reads like English prose, so vale flags it
#     for headings, "will", passive voice, and so on.
#
#   - Everything from the scissors line
#     `# ------------------------ >8 ------------------------` to
#     EOF when `commit.verbose=true` is set, which is the project
#     default for any reviewer who wants the diff visible while
#     editing. The diff itself contains `--git` (em-dash trigger)
#     and other tokens vale would otherwise treat as prose.
#
# The hook receives the message-buffer path as `$1` (`.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG`
# from git, or `COMMIT_AGENTMSG` from the `lint-commit-msg` recipe).

# The agent reads vale's findings, so the operator's locale must not
# reshape them. The pin does a second job on macOS: BSD sed aborts with
# "illegal byte sequence" when a UTF-8 locale meets a byte the message
# cannot decode, and under C it walks the buffer byte by byte instead. vale
# and git both read UTF-8 regardless of the locale, so the cleaned text
# reaching the linter is unchanged.

# resolves a bare template name against `<StylesPath>/config/templates/`,
# and the hook runs from the consumer repo's root, so probing that path
# through the StylesPath in the local .vale.ini decides whether the
# template exists. The parse reads the value from the config because
# consumer repos differ on the directory name (`.vale` here, `styles`
# elsewhere). When .vale.ini, the StylesPath key, or the template file
# is missing, the flag stays empty and the default output is unchanged.

# vale selects its rule scope from the path of the file it lints. An
# earlier version copied the cleaned message to a temp `*.md` file,
# which matched the generic `[*.md]` scope and silently skipped the
# `ai-tells-commits` rules that only the `[{COMMIT_EDITMSG,...}]` scope
# enables. Piping the cleaned text on stdin and labelling it via
# `--path` with the message basename selects that scope. The basename
# keeps the match working whether `$1` arrives relative or absolute.
#
# `--ext` picks the parser, and it has to be passed explicitly. vale
# keys `[formats]` on a file extension, and these buffers have none, so
# no entry there reaches them and the text parses as plain lines. That
# leaves a backticked CLI flag looking like prose, which is how a rule
# such as DoubleHyphen fires on `--all-files` written inside backticks
# and no wording clears it. Naming the markdown parser makes a code
# span a code span again. It does not widen the scope: `--path` still
# decides that, so the `ai-tells-commits` rules keep firing rather than
# falling back to the generic `[*.md]` set this comment warns about.
#
# sed cuts from the scissors marker through EOF. The pattern matches
# the scissors text loosely (any number of dashes, optional spacing
# around the `>8`) and accepts the configurable `core.commentChar`
# via the `[#;]` character class. `git stripspace --strip-comments`
# then drops the remaining comment lines using git's own commentChar
# rules.
